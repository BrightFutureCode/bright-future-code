# Bright Future Code

## The Idea

At Bright Future Code, we believe in the immense potential of software to create
lasting, positive change in the world. Yet, we understand that for non-profits
and individuals with visionary ideas, financial constraints can often stand in
the way of bringing these transformative ideas to life.

We also are sure there are developers out there who are eager to make a
difference outside their day-to-day jobs, but lack the right project or the
insights that can turn their skills into world-changing software.

That's where Bright Future Code comes in. Our mission is to bridge this gap â€“
connecting these two crucial forces: the inspired project proposers and the
developers wanting to make a difference.
We are here to help you join forces, ignite change, and together, build a
brighter tomorrow.
