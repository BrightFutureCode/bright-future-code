    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      Hi, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹<br /><br />
      We are BrightFutureCode, a non-profit collective of developers aspiring to
      use our skills to make the world a better place. We've realized that while
      there are countless projects where software can make a significant impact,
      connecting with these opportunities isn't always straightforward unless
      you "know someone".
    </p>

    <p>
      That's why we founded BrightFutureCode: Our platform is designed to
      empower developers who want to volunteer their time and skills but don't
      want to spend endless hours searching for the right project.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are here to bridge the gap, providing a space where passionate coders
      and transformative project ideas come together. At BrightFutureCode, we're
      all about turning good intentions into powerful actions, one line of code
      at a time.
    </p>
