    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>
      At BrightFutureCode, we believe in the immense potential of software to
      create lasting, positive change in the world. Yet, we understand that for
      non-profits and individuals with visionary ideas, financial constraints
      can often stand in the way of bringing these transformative ideas to life.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also are sure there are developers out there who are eager to make a
      difference outside their day-to-day jobs, but lack the right project or
      the insights that can turn their skills into world-changing software.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's where BrightFutureCode comes in. Our mission is to bridge this gap
      â€“ connecting these two crucial forces: the inspired project proposers and
      the developers wanting to make a difference.<br />
      We are here to help you join forces, ignite change, and together, build a
      brighter tomorrow.
